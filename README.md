# Rustydo

This is a terminal based TODO list made with Rust, using the [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) crate.

## Building process

Just making the UI to render a basic view of a list of tasks.

Lately, I'm planing to make a database saving all the information. I'm thinking about Redis, but I don't know yet.

## TODO

- update README
